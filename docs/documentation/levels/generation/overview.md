Our levels are generated using a scene, [level_generator](../generation/level_generator.md) that uses a random walk algorithm in order to place tiles. The scene makes use of two custom resources in the same directory, [tile.gd](../generation/custom-resources/tile.) and [map.gd](../generation/custom-resources/map.gd.md).
